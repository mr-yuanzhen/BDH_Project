# ðŸ©º FarSight: Long-Term Disease Prediction from Nursing Notes (Reproduction)

This project reproduced part of the **FarSight** paper:

> **FarSight: Long-Term Disease Prediction Using Unstructured Clinical Nursing Notes**  
> *Rashmi Gangwar, Ritam Dutt, Harsh Vardhan Pant, Udit Kumar, et al.*

The goal is to predict **ICD-9 diagnostic code groups** using only **unstructured nursing notes** from the MIMIC-III clinical dataset.  
This repository replicates the main pipeline using traditional and deep learning models â€” including **NMF on BoW + MLP** and **ClinicalBERT** â€” for **multi-label disease prediction**.
